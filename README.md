## Disclaimer
This project is a fan continuation of a project created and developed by koki_thlal/Technodot, but is not affiliated with or in contact with the above in any way.

Additionally, out of respect to the copyright holders of originally-referenced material, many assets have been replaced with placeholders.

While older or alternate versions exist using the original `ShaGResource.tcd` and `ShaGPattern.tcd` files, this repository will only maintain the placeholder resources, which can be used to overwrite the above files to replace the graphics.

# ShanghaiEXE
Shanghai.EXE was a fangame inspired by Touhou and Megaman Battle Network.

Then the original developer got a C&D from Capcom and shut everything down, just before it was completed.

Luckily, someone leaked a donor-wall demo build, and the whole thing was made in C#, which meant it could be decompiled.

This is a modified/translated version of that demo build, re-implementing teased content and planning to finish the game, fixing bugs along the way.

The end goal is to complete the game, including postgame areas/bosses, sidequests/bosses, and netplay.

## Map Editor
![Editor](https://i.imgur.com/UKmk3E5.png)
The map/script files in the `data/` folder define the overworld portion of the game, including the story, cutscenes, and most events.

The map editor is a user-friendly GUI to modify those map files and should be capable of recreating any existing maps from scratch, or creating any new maps needed to finish the game.

The editor also includes utilities to pack/unpack the game resources, and an editor/previewer for ingame text.

## Note to developers

Visual Studio 2017 is required to compile the project due to the C# 7 syntax generated by decompilation.

Additionally, the C++ development environment must be installed for Visual Studio in order for freetype6.dll to be copied to the output directory.
